## Hex in Java ##

Folked This project from https://github.com/dpearson/Hex 

Improved beta-alpha search tree with multiple heuristics function to evaulat future board state.

### Building ###

You'll need a few dependencies; these include a JDK, `make`, and `zip`. I've only tested the code on Java 6, although both the OpenJDK and the Sun one work.

Then, just run:

    make jar
    java -jar Hex.jar
